Several solutions address the specificity issue:

**1. Increase Specificity of :has() Selector:**  We can add a class to the container to increase its specificity.

```css
.container-has-p:has(> p) {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

And update your HTML:

```html
<div class="container container-has-p">
  <p>Some text</p>
</div>
```

**2.  Using a More Specific Parent Selector (If Applicable):** If possible, modify the parent selector to be more specific to the situation where you want the `:has()` rule to apply.

**3. (Less Recommended) Using `!important`:** This is generally discouraged due to its potential for widespread cascading issues.

```css
.container:has(> p) {
  background-color: lightblue !important;
}
```

Choose the solution that best fits your overall CSS structure and maintainability.  Adding a specific class is usually the most robust approach.
